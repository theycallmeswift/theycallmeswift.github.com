title: Introducing the Rutgers Hackathon Club
---

_TLDR; With the second iteration of [HackRU](http://hackerleague.org/hackathons/hackru)
coming up this weekend, I figured that now would be as good a time as any to
talk about hacking culture at my alma mater._

### Where winners are forged

There are a lot of things that [Rutgers University](http://rutgers.edu) is
known for.  Hosting and winning [the first college football match](http://scarletknights.com/football/history/first-game.asp),
our recently discontinued [school holiday](http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/04/rutgers_to_cancel_annual_rutge.html),
[sandwiches with literally everything on them](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=fat+sandwich+rutgers&tbm=isch).
But one of the things we don't get enough recognition for is our strong hacking
culture.  Rutgers students have been building awesome stuff for a long time
and we've made [bettering the hackathon community](http://hackerleague.org/) a priority.
In preparation for the second annual HackRU (which is coming up this weekend and you should
[register now](http://hackerleague.org/hackathons/hackru/) if you haven't 
already), here's a brief overview of some of our hacking accomplishments at 
Rutgers.

### A growing force

I founded the Rutgers Hackathon Club back in 2010 after I'd attended my first
few events.  At that point, there was a pretty strong representation in the
community from [the local New York universities](http://hackny.org/a/), but I really wanted to see
Rutgers emerge as one of the top contributors.  We've since grown from 3
members to 45 and attended at least as many events together:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><td colspan="2">Some of the hackathons we've attended</td></tr>
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>HackNY (x5)</li>
        <li>PennApps (x3)</li>
        <li>HackRU</li>
        <li>Visualization Marathon</li>
        <li>New England College Hackathon</li>
        <li>Geeklist</li>
        <li>Node Knockout</li>
        <li>Techcrunch Disrupt</li>
        <li>Google Games</li>
        <li>Code Sprint (x2)</li>
        <li>New York Times (x2)</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>Django Dash</li>
        <li>Clean Web Hackathon</li>
        <li>Bit.ly (x2)</li>
        <li>Hacker Cup</li>
        <li>Lean Startup Machine</li>
        <li>Hacker Olympics</li>
        <li>Hack Princeton</li>
        <li>DevFest</li>
        <li>Photo Hack Day</li>
        <li>Art Hack Day</li>
        <li>Foursquare (x2)</li>
        <li>Startup Weekend (x4)</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

That's a pretty good sized list, and even if we only produced one entry per
event, that would mean there are at least 40 projects we've hacked into existence
over a span of two years.  Realistically, the Rutgers hackers usually average 
about 3-4 projects per event, which would put that number somewhere in the
hundreds.

### The Sampler Platter

Of course not every project was a winner, but thanks to a 
combination of [the Hacker League listings](http://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons),
some old tweets, and a few quick Google searches, I've managed to compile a list of some of
the award winning hacks that Rutgers students have produced over the years.
It's a shame that it's not more complete, but regardless I think you'll find
what's here entertaining, impressive, and definitely worth a read.
