title: Principle Philosophy
---

Here are my slides and a paraphrased summary of some of the things that I talked
about at [DjangoCon EU 2013](http://djangocon.eu/).  You can find the [full slides on
SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/theycallmeswift/principle-philosophy-for-developers-entrepreneurs-and-artists)
and there's even [a video of the talk on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWCWkRXlN94).

![Title Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0003.jpg)

Originally this talk was called "How to build the tools that developers want to
use", but I actually decided to cancel it and talk about something slightly
different instead.  When I was working on that original talk, I was coming up
with all these pointers about how to make great software that people want to
use again and again.

And I got to thinking about why I was coming up with these
specific things because while I definitly agreed with them in some context, I didn't
think they were universally true.  So I got to thinking about how I made
decisions and came across something that was a little more fundamental to my
identity as a developer, entrepreneur, and artist, and that's the idea of 
"Principle Philosophy".

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0005.jpg)

The first thing to note is that I'm not talking about your school principal,
instead I'm talking about the other kind of principles.  The ones that help us
make decisions on a day to day basis.  The guidelines that we use when we're
making choices.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0006.jpg)

And I want to combine that with this idea of philosophy, which is just a way of
thinking about, discussing, and studying ideas in an intelectual manner.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0007.jpg)

And so when we take those two ideas and combine them we end up with "Principle
Philosophy", which is just a way of thinking about and discussing the rules that
dictate our behaviors - out principles.  And specifically I want to look at the
principles that I've picked up over the years that have made me a better
developer, entrepreneur, and artist.  And I want to share them with you in the
hopes that they will help you as well.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0008.jpg)

So, let's take a step back and talk about who I am.  Just to avoid and
confusion, I am not Ryan Golsing, I'm actually Swift (despite the handsome
resemblance).  I'm a developer evangelist over at
[SendGrid](http://sendgrid.com).  If you've never heard of SendGrid, we're an
API company that makes it super simple to send and recieve emails.  I'm also one
of the founders of [Hacker League](http://hackerleague.org), which is a platform
for people who organize and attend hackathons.

I have all these roles that are developer and startup facing and I have the
privilege of being able to help them a lot.  Specifically I have the opportunity
to help them succeed and get better at what they do.  I find that very rewarding
and I trace that fact back to some of the things my parents were taught me when
I was growing up.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0009.jpg)

I was my parent's first child and when they were figuring out how to raise me,
they were looking for a good success metric.  How do we know we've done a good
job raising our son?  And the answer was that they wanted me to be a "Good
Person".  And by that they meant they wanted me to be a successful, contributing
member of society who worked hard and did the right thing.

So they found themselves asking, "How can we raise our son to be a good
person?".  And the answer that they came up with came back to those principles
that we talked about a little earlier.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0010.jpg)

If you lay out a strong foundation for somebody that's based on good things and
they follow those things and stick to them rigidly.  And they don't do things
that violate those principles, then they'll end up good.  And that makes sense
right?

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0011.jpg)

So they were teaching me things like:

 - Always do my best
 - Don't be a quitter
 - Help those less fortunate
 - Don't steal

And the list goes on, but as long as I stuck to them and didn't do things that
violated this good foundation of principles, then I would end up as a "good"
person.

And this all makes sense, but I think that the way that we go about approaching
these things and thinking about them is total bullshit.  And I'll tell you why.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0012.jpg)

It's because they're very black & white concepts.  Either I'm stealing or I'm
not, either I'm doing my best or I'm not.  And most things that you'll find on a
day-to-day basis don't actually fit into this black & white, boolean style way
of thinking.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0013.jpg)

The truth is that things are more like gray & gray.  We end up using tools like
pro / con checklists to decide which side a that black & white line something
falls on, but it's very rare that something falls cleanly on one side or
another.

Up to this point, I don't think that any of this should be terribly surprising
to anyone because we make these decions on a daily basis.  But I think something
that's a lot more interesting is how we go about answering this next question.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0014.jpg)

How can I be a good programmer?  When we think about the ways that programmers
make decisions, we think about them as very logical and methodical people.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0015.jpg)

After all, they deal with things like code or math all day.  These things are
built in steps and are either right or wrong (read black & white).  And that's
a little scary considering how we just talked about how bad black & white
paradigms are for gray inputs.

But being logical, methodical people, programmers must have a better system for
deciding what's good and bad, right?

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0016.jpg)

The truth is we don't.  We go around saying things like:

 - Don't repeat yourself in code
 - Write tests
 - Open Source your tools
 - Blah, blah, blah 

And they're the same old black & white rules that we've been
having problems with on a day to day basis and we expect them to handle our
super gray inputs.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0017.jpg)

And the even sillier thing is that we get so passionate about these things that
we go on the Internet and yell at eachother because we don't agree with the way
that other people are interpreting these principles.  Things like "ruby is
better than python" or "you shouldn't write unit tests", and it's absolutely
obsurd because we all know that applying these gray inputs to black and white
functions is a craps shoot.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0018.jpg)

We seem to still think that we have a decision making fuction that looks some
thing like this.  We get a thing.  We take a look at the thing.  If the thing is
good we do it, and if it's not, we don't.  But guess what?  It doesn't actually
work like that.

So the questions I would next raise are "how do we know what's good?" and "how
do we know what's worth doing?".  And it's really hard to answer those without 
talking about this guy.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0019.jpg)

[Immanuel Kant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant).  If you don't know
him, he's a German philosopher who lived during the Enlightment.  He's widely
considered to be the Godfather of modern philosophy because it's pretty hard to
have a discussion without bringing up some of his arguments or someone who was
influenced by them.

He had some really interesting stuff that he talked about, especially in regard
to morality and how that functions with our ability to reason.  These next few
slides are a summary of some of those arguments and my interpretation of them.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0020.jpg)

The first thing wanted to know was why we have the ability to reason.  Why do we
have this gift of being able to think logically about things?  And this is
incredibly relevant to our earlier discussion of programmers.

A lot of people would say that it must be for our own happiness, but Kant
disagreed.  If life was about going around being happy then we would just follow
our instincts.  The choices become pretty obvious when all you're thinking about
is yourself all the time.  But the truth is, we do things all the time that are
not in our own best interests, and since that happens reason must be around for
some other purpose.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0021.jpg)

He came up with this idea that our reasoning must be around for us to be good.
That the fact that we're capable of reason means that we must be capable of
moral, good decisions.  This brings us back to the original question that I
posed and fits with my parents model and the principles that they were trying to
instill in me.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0022.jpg)

So how do we actually know if something is good?  Kant had this three pronged
argument.  This is a really condensed version of these three points, so I highly
recommend you read the full thing yourself if you want to get a deeper view into
these things.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0023.jpg)

The first prong was this idea of duty.  Duty is some kind of moral or legal
obligation that you have to fulfill.  And Kant said that good things always come
from our pursuit of duty.  So as you're pursuing these moral obligations, good
things will come naturally.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0024.jpg)

But not all things we do from duty are necessarily good.  And a good example of
this might be something like open source.  Think about your motivations for
doing open source: 

 - You want others to do open source too (not duty, not moral)
 - You want to make people happy (duty, not moral)
 - It's the right thing to do (duty, maybe moral)

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0025.jpg)

The next thing Kant got into was that the morality of an action should be
separate from the goal or the actual outcome of that action.  It has to come
from the actual underlying principles that you build on - "the principle of the
will" as he called it.  You do things that are good that have a bad result;
things that are the right thing to do, but just happen to have a crappy outcome.
And that doesn't make it bad or anything, it just means it had a bad outcome.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0026.jpg)

The third thing was the idea of universal lawfulness.  It's the idea that you
shouldn't do something unless you're okay with literally everyone else in the
world being able to do that thing too.  So we don't steal because then there
would be no sense of ownership because everyone would just steal from eachother.
Likewise, maybe tests are universally acceptable because it would be ok for
everyone to rigidly test everything unconditionally (just an example).

I think all of these rules provide a pretty good foundation for how we decide if
things are good or bad, right or wrong, and I agree with everything that Kant
has said so far.  But the part where we start to differ is here:

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0027.jpg)

The idea of priori vs posteriori knowledge.  Kant says that the things that we
do that are good must come from the priori knowledge, which is knowledge that we
just naturally have; our gut moral feelings.  Alternatively, our posteriori
knowledge comes from our experiences and is based on our subjective knowledge
and therefore cannot be moral.

And I totally diagree with this, because I think it's impossible for us to
totally separate out our decisions from our past experiences and I think I make
plenty of good, moral choices daily while relying on that.  In fact, our
principles are actually directly tied to our experiences and a lot of them
develop directly out of things we've gone through.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0028.jpg)

And I think Gandhi actually summed that up really nicly in this quote. 

> "A man is the sum of his actions, of what he has done, of what he can do,
> nothing else."

What he's getting at here is how impossible it is to separate ourselves from our past
experiences.  So I want take this, and revisit that really niave function that we defined
before.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0029.jpg)

It probably looks something it probably looks a little more like this in
reality.  We look at more than just some arbitrary boolean when we make
decisions.  We actually calculate a value based on our past experiences and
their outcomes.  And if we don't have anything in our experiences that would fit
the specific case, then we weigh the good against the bad and make a decision
based on that.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0030.jpg)

So essentially we boil down to the sum of our experiences; we are this value.
The best thing that we can possibly do is optimize our experiences so that this
expression evaluates to be as large as possible; we have the biggest
pool of things to draw on when we're making decisions.

There's two ways we can go about doing this.  The first way is through our
first-hand experiences, which are the things that we're doing every day.  These
are the choices we make and the results of those choices evaluated in our own
subjective context.

The second part is the reason that things like conferences and networking events 
are so important, it's your network experience.  These are the experiences that
your friends, mentors, family, peers have been through and share with you.
These let us expand our foundation of experiences to draw from at an exponential
rate.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0031.jpg)

Everything looks different from the outside.  Unless you've gone through something 
or know someone who's gone through something, it can be hard to make the right decision.
So the knowledge that you get from your network and the knowledge that you get
from making choices every day is super important, and without it we can't
possibly find the answer to questions like "Am I a good programmer or person?".

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0032.jpg)

Up to this point we've talked a lot about the theory about why we make decsions;
about what makes something good and bad; about how important principles are for
building up a foundation; about how important the experiences that we go through
are.  But now I want to get more into the practice, I want to tell you a story
about something that I got a ton of value from and how it made me a better
programmer, entrepreneur, and artist.  And I hope this helps you too.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0033.jpg)

This story is actually about Little League.  If you're not familiar with Little
League, it's a suburban American tradition where little kids get together on
Saturdays and play baseball.  Parents come and watch them play and cheer for
their kids' teams.

I played in my town's Little League from the first day I was eligible until the
last day I was eligible, but it wasn't because I was great at baseball.  It was
actually quite the opposite case.  I was *horrible* at baseball.  I could barely
catch the ball, I definitly couldn't throw it, and sometimes when I would swing
the bat I would accidentally let go and it would hit people.

Overall it was a really horrible experience to play and I *hated* it.  I wasn't
motivated to try because I was so bad.  I really wanted to quit.  So one day, I
approached my parents and said, "Mom, Dad, I know you think it's a good idea for
me to play in the Little League because I'm meeting people and doing something
athletic.  But the truth is, I hate it and don't want to do it anymore.  I
quit."

My parents looked at me and said, "Hang on, we need a minute to talk about
this".  They went outside, chatted for a few minutes, and then came back to
pass on their ruling.  They looked at me and said something to the effect of
"No, you're not quitting.  We aren't raising a quitter for a son".

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0034.jpg)

Instead of that decision motivating me to go out and give Little League a second
try, it actually made me even more unmotivated to try to find some kind of value
from baseball.  So rather than sitting the bench and half-assingly playing right
field, I would do things like laying down in the grass instead of playing.  Then
at least the coach would pull me out and send me on my way home early.

My teammates became increasingly more hostile towards me because they could tell I
wasn't even trying to play anymore.  Effectively I accomplished the complete opposite 
of what my parents were trying to get me to do.  I had quit without actually
quitting.

My parents saw what was going on and tried to figure out a way to motivate me
and get me to find some value from the whole experience.  What they came up with
was a monetary inscentive.  They promised me $100 if I could ever manage to hit
a home run.  At the time, that was a lot of money to me.  Especially considering
I wasn't actually doing any serious manual labor to earn it.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0035.jpg)

I got it in my head that I wanted this $100 more than anything.  Things
started to change.  I would go to baseball games and actually try to hit the
ball.  Don't get me wrong, I didn't get better over night.  It was a very rocky
road along the way, and I still sucked at baseball, but I managed to slowly improve
a inch by inch.  I managed to hit the ball a few times and everyone was
definitely more supportive now that I was actually trying.

Fast forward to some time near the end of my Little League career.  It wasn't
the last game.  It wasn't the bottom of the 9th.  The bases weren't loaded.
There was nothing dramatic about this day except that I only had a few chances
left to hit that home run.  I get up to bat this particular day.  The pitcher
throws the ball.  I close my eyes and swing the bat as hard as I possibly can.

Crack.  I make contact and the ball goes flying.  I look up and the ball is
sailing towards that fence.  Closer and closer every second, I can feel that
it's going to go over.  But it doesn't.  It falls just short of the fence.  No
home run once again.

I look up and at this moment realize that the entire time this was happening *I
never started running*.  All these people, my parents, my coach, my teamates, are
behind me screaming at the top of their lungs, wanting me to run. Go! Go! Go! I started
running.

Needless to say I was out before I even hit first base.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0036.jpg)

So the sad ending to this story is that I never actually hit that home run.  I
never accomplished that goal, but I certainly learned a lot from that whole
experience.  And in hindsight, I think the thing that was so important to me
wasn't necessarily the money that my parents had promised me.  Instead it was
that I wanted to make them happy, or proud, or show them that I could do it.
And I got a lot out of the in particular.

I want to examine some of the other things I learned from that experience and
talk about how they made me a better programmer, entrepreneur, and artist.  And
hopefully, this will help you learn to examine some of your own experiences and
principles too.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0037.jpg)

The first thing that I leared was to always "swing for the fences".  And I know
that's kind of a cliche when you're talking about baseball.  Ha.  But serious, I
think having a big vision is super important for equiping you to have a big
success down the road.

There are several reasons for this, but mainly it prevents burnout and enables
you to take bigger risks.  I also think people tend to understand big goals a
lot easier than little ones, so they're certainly easier to share with other
people.

As a developer, this has been instrumental to the way that I do my job.
Developers have this tendency to stick with what they know.  If you're a Django
dev and every day all you do is write Django apps, well there isn't much of a
chance that one day you'll wake up and decide to write your next production app
in Rails or Node.js.  Having a large goal enables you to take dramatic,
deviating risks because you have a lot of ground to cover anyway.

I have a good example of this.  At the time, I was working at [Crowdtap](http://crowdtap.com/) as a
Rails developer.  We had this monolithic test suite that would take 3 hours to
run.  So every day, we would push branches to CI and then 3 hours later they
come back red and we'd have to stop what we were doing and fix them.  Not very
productive.

So one day, the CTO comes to me and asks me to work on cutting down the time it
takes to run the suite.  I set a large goal for myself.  I wanted to cut the
time in half.  To get there, I could have done the obvious things like moving to
a faster box, caching, cutting down the database calls, etc.  But since I had
such a large goal, I went for something totaly radical in Node.js and managed to
cut out a whole 25 minutes from the build
([details](/2012/05/01/excuse-me-thats-not-an-integration-test/),
[slides](.  It wasn't the hour & a half I
wanted, but it was probably more than I would have gotten playing close to the vest.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0038.jpg)

The next thing I want to talk about is about having small goals to build up to
your big ones.  I never conciously planned this out while I was playing
baseball, but between where I started and that home run there was a lot of
ground for me to cover.  I made a ton of incremental steps that helped me get to
where I ended up and the same has held true for me software engineering career.

I maintain a library called [Breakfast Serial](https://github.com/theycallmeswift/BreakfastSerial), which helps programmers talk to
Arduinos using Python.  It gives them a set of simple, high level objects to
work with so they can build things quickly and iterate.  My big goal for the
library is to be the best library out there for Arduino and Python, but I can't
just do that over night.  To get there I've been setting small goals of adding
individual components to the library.  First it was LEDs, then buttons, then
sensors, and so on.  Small steps forward.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0039.jpg)

The next one is that it's totally fine to be bad at things.  You don't have to
be good at everything you do and, in fact, being bad can help you gain a new
perspective on things.  People at the top don't usually start from the bottom,
so you can end up with the upper hand because you think of things differently.

[Hacker League](http://hackerleague.org/) has been a great example of that for me.  When I started Hacker
League, I actually never even won a hackathon.  I had a history riddled with
failure and disappointment.  A year and a half later, we've run over 300 events
including big names like [Tech Crunch Disrupt](https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/techcrunch-disrupt-nyc-2013) 
and [Evernote's DevCup](https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/evernote-devcup-2013).

Being at the bottom gave me the insight to focus on things that were more
important than sponsorship and who won because I learned their value first hand,
and we ended up better off for it.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0040.jpg)

This next one is quote that most people attribute to Mark Twain, but I'm pretty
sure that's not true.

 > Quitting is easy.  I've done it thousands of times.

Usually it's used in reference to smoking, drinking, or gambling, but what I
really want to talk about here is that quitting can be the easy way out.  My
parents were absolutly right about this, and it's been instrumental to my
personal development that they didn't let me quit things.

One of the hardest things when you're building tools for other people to use is
when they don't end up using them.  I maintain a number of repositiories that
almost nobody, including myself, uses any more.  And that's hard, right?  Why
would you want to work on something that nobody is using, and the easy thing to
do would be not work on them.  If someone submits a bug, it's just one person so
what does it matter?

Persistance is really the key for success.  And I don't mean to say that you
can't ever quit anything, I just mean that you need to give a valient effort
before you can legitimately stop something.  Just like when I was playing
baseball and not trying, things got a lot better once I started to put some
effort in and the same is also true for software engineering. 

The end might not be anywhere in sight, and you might never hit that home run, but 
giving something a shot and not giving up on it can be the difference between
mediocracy and success.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0041.jpg)

There's way more examples in the [video of this talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWCWkRXlN94), 
so if you're interested I highly recommend checking that out.

We've talked about a lot of things now.  How we make choices, decide what's
good, how our experiences and principles help us do those things, and even an
example of some of it in action.  But where do we go from here?

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0043.jpg)

We should go back to our original question of "*How can I be a good X?*".  These
kinds of questions are fundamentally flawed.  We know that everyone has a
different foundation and pool of experience to draw from.  We know that one
size doesn't fit all when it comes to making the right choice.  We know that
expiences and principles are relative to ourselves even though we may share them
with other people.  So I think we need to start asking a better question.

We should start asking ourselves things like "How can I can be a **better**
programmer, entrepreneur, or artist?"  And all we have to do is optimize the
materials that we rely on to make decisions. 

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0046.jpg)

So I want to leave you with some action items, and I realize that these are
pretty general, but just think about them the next time you're making a decision
or you're critizing someone else's decisions.

 - Build a strong foundation of principles
 - Remember one size doesn't fit all
 - Learn from and share your experiences
 - Build a great network
 - Ask the right questions

Even when things are totally unrelated to programming, your experiences and the
principles that you're building from those experiences will help shape that part
of your life too.  Those experiences will help you become a better programmer,
entrepreneur, artist, or whatever you may be.
