title: Don't Throw that Hackathon
---

These are my slides and a paraphrased summary of my talk from the [API
Strategy & Practice Conference](http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2013SF/index.php)
in San Francisco.  You can find the full slides on [SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/theycallmeswift/dont-throw-that-hackathon) and when
the video goes live, I'll be sure to post that as well.

![Don't Throw that Hackathon](/img/dont-throw-that-hackathon/page0001.jpg)

Let me start by saying, "I love hackathons."  If you've ever met me before,
that's probably not a huge surprise.  Over the last few years, I've literally
been to hundreds of them and played every role from hacker to organizer and
back.  I've also founded a couple of hackathon related companies (more on
those later) and I've been known to write about hackathon occasionally too.
These are some observations I've made along the way.

![They Call Me Swift](/img/dont-throw-that-hackathon/page0002.jpg)

So if you've ever seen me speak before, you know this obligatory slide is
coming already.  Believe it or not, despite the handsome resemblance, I am
actually not Ryan Gosling.  They actually call me Swift.  I'm one of the
founders of this little outfit called [Hacker League](https://www.hackerleague.org/)
and I'm the commissioner of this thing called [Major League Hacking](http://mlh.io/)
(think NCAA meets College Hackathons).  I'm also pretty well known for my
former role as a Developer Evangelist over at [SendGrid](http://sendgrid.com/).

Between all those roles, I spent a lot of time at these things called
"Hackathons".  So let me take a step back and ask the question, "[What
is a hackathon?](https://medium.com/hackathons-anonymous/92668579601)".

![What is a hackathon?](/img/dont-throw-that-hackathon/page0003.jpg)

Hackathons are these collaborative events where people who make things
(developers, designers, hardware people, etc.) get together for some time
interval and do what they do best - make awesome stuff.  The format that most
of you are probably familiar with is the 24 hour hackathon.  Hackers get
together in the morning and hack around the clock for a full 24 hours.
Companies like yours spend time walking around helping them build stuff.
And at the end, everyone shows off whatever they hacked together.

![Famous Hackathons](/img/dont-throw-that-hackathon/page0004.jpg)

It's an awesome experience.  If you haven't at least been to one, you should
check it out.  These are some of the big names you may have heard of in the
space.  These events take place all over the world and range from a room full
of developers up into the thousands of attendees.

![On the Rise](/img/dont-throw-that-hackathon/page0005.jpg)

This is a graph of the events that my startup, [Hacker League](https://www.hackerleague.org/),
has powered since we launched in October 2011.  As you can see, the number
of hackathons that are happening every month is going up at a pretty spectacular
rate.

![Why are companies going to Hackathons](/img/dont-throw-that-hackathon/page0006.jpg)

I don't have a pretty graph to show this one, but the number of companies
getting involved is also pretty astounding.  There's a couple of student
events that I work with through Major League Hacking that consistently raise
in the mid 100s of thousands of dollars every semester for their event.

So the question that comes to mind is "Why are so many companies getting
involved in Hackathons?"  Based purely on the rising number of events and
the astronomical sponsorships that the organizers are able to raise, there's
certainly something worth investigating here.

![3 Main Reasons](/img/dont-throw-that-hackathon/page0007.jpg)

Broadly speaking, I've broken the reasons that companies get involved in
hackathons into three big categories.  Now, you can certainly fall into more
than one of these buckets, but I think there's always one strategy that
dominates the others.  And each of these buckets has its own *optimal*
strategy for how to approach these events.

![Product Feedback](/img/dont-throw-that-hackathon/page0008.jpg)

The first kind of company is the kind that's going to hackathons for direct
product feedback.  A lot of companies want to be like these guys, but it's the
hardest to imitate for sure.

![Product Feedback: Goal](/img/dont-throw-that-hackathon/page0009.jpg)

These companies want to optimize their products by going directly to their
customers and watching them use it.  Developers are the customers of the
companies I'm talking about specifically, and what better place is there to
watch your customers integrate your products in real time than a hackathon?

Generally speaking, there is some kind of direct feedback mechanism that these
companies bring to hackathons.  The most successful of these are probably
Developer Evangelists because they know to listen for the things that
developers really care about and hone in on those.

![Product Feedback: Examples](/img/dont-throw-that-hackathon/page0010.jpg)

Here are some companies that you might be familiar with that employ this
strategy well.  These companies have some of the best developer evangelism
programs in the world right now and there's a good reason for that.  The best
evangelists aren't just marketing a product, they're helping to build it.
They're taking everything they're seeing at hackathons and piping that
directly back into the engine that produces it.

![Marketing](/img/dont-throw-that-hackathon/page0012.jpg)

The second category of company that gets involved in hackathons is what I'm
calling "Mindshare & Perception".  You guys probably call it "marketing".  I
wanted to be less general than that because I think this one can actually be
broken down into two distinct sub-categories.

![Marketing: Mindshare Goal](/img/dont-throw-that-hackathon/page0013.jpg)

The first sub-category is mindshare.  These companies want to associate their
brand with awesome stuff so that developers think of them in relevant
contexts.  For example, if you're a hacker who is suddenly in need of venture
capital for your new app, it's very likely that you will fall back on one of
the VCs that often shows their face at hackathons.  That's especially true if
you met someone from the brand there.

![Marketing: Mindshare Examples](/img/dont-throw-that-hackathon/page0014.jpg)

Here are some examples of companies that I think might fall into this bucket.
If you're a developer, you probably won't be surprised by some of these logos
because they're literally on every good event these days.  There's also some
relatively early stage examples here.  Mindshare is especially important for
them because any gained real estate is significantly more than they had
before.

![Marketing: Perception Goal](/img/dont-throw-that-hackathon/page0015.jpg)

The other marketing sub-category is companies that want to work on their
perception.  Generally speaking, these are larger or older companies that
aren't *trendy and cool* luck the young, agile companies that dominate this
market place.  The want to put their logos on as much cool stuff as possible
so developers don't discount them when they're making decisions.


![Marketing: Perception Examples](/img/dont-throw-that-hackathon/page0016.jpg)

Here's some examples of those companies.  I think these should be pretty
obvious for the most part.  This is a pretty expensive strategy to pursue and
I certainly think there are better ways, but I get where they're coming from
and why they do it.

![Recruiting](/img/dont-throw-that-hackathon/page0017.jpg)

And that brings us to the last category: recruiting.  This is arguably the
most and least successful of the three simultaneously.  If you get into this
one, make sure you do your research about which events you should hit because
some are **way** better than others for picking up top talent.

![Recruiting: Goal](/img/dont-throw-that-hackathon/page0018.jpg)

The math here is pretty simple: the top talent goes to lots of hackathons because
it's a way to keep your skills sharp and meet a bunch of other smart, driven
folks.  If you go to a hackathon, you may be able to hire them.  It's also a
great opportunity to build long-term relationships with the hackers.  This is
**extremely** effective if done right.

![Recruiting: Examples](/img/dont-throw-that-hackathon/page0019.jpg)

And of course, here are some examples of companies that recruit effectively at
hackathons.  Note that I said "effectively" though.  For each of these
companies, there are 10 that think it's a job fair and look silly.  Make sure
you keep in mind that most of the hackers aren't there to find a new gig.

![Silly reasons for hackathoning](/img/dont-throw-that-hackathon/page0020.jpg)

Now that you've seen those general categories of companies that get involved
in hackathons, you have a leg up on the rest of the field.  Most companies
don't realize that each of those goals has its own optimal strategy to
accompany it.  They see either the peers or their competitors at these events
and want to reap the same benefits.  So they jump into it head first without
doing any research and disasters ensue.

So here's the first big mistake they make:  they decide that they want to
throw *their own* hackathon.

![Don't throw that Hackathon](/img/dont-throw-that-hackathon/page0023.jpg)

Seriously though, don't do it.  I know it sounds counter-intuitive: if we get
all these benefits out of being around hackathons, why not just throw our own
and make the developers come to us?  Well here's the protip: The reasons that
your company does hackathons and the reasons that developers do hackathons are
fundamentally different.  There's a very small subset of developer who wants
to be marketed to and recruited, and usually that subset isn't the one you're
trying to hit.

![The killer question](/img/dont-throw-that-hackathon/page0024.jpg)

Usually there is a better alternative to throwing a hackathon (especially if
you've already acquired the budget to do it).  I have this killer question
that I use to get it out of people.

 > What are you trying to accomplish by throwing a hackathon?

You'd be amazed how many people haven't even thought this one through.  If you
can't answer it, you need to go back to the drawing board and figure that out
first.  Once you know what you're trying to accomplish, you can usually figure
out what the right thing to do is.

If the reason you come up with is any of the three reasons I outlined already,
your best bet is to sponsor one of the amazing events that exist already.
Seriously, go back to that slide with all the hackathons, pick one and sponsor
it.  They'd be super happy to have your help and I guarantee you can reach
your goal there.

Here are a couple of other common goals I hear and some good alternatives to
throwing a hackathon for them.

![Get Startups](/img/dont-throw-that-hackathon/page0025.jpg)

The first one I usually hear is the company that's trying to acquire new
customers or startups to use their APIs.  We hear stories about GroupMe and
Zaarly and suddenly hackathons become the place to find the next million
dollar company.

![Hacks are Hacks](/img/dont-throw-that-hackathon/page0026.jpg)

Here's another Protip: Hacks are hacks, not startups.  A huge majority of the
hacks that get built at these things will not exist beyond the event.  One of
the main value props of Hacker League is that we preserve the history of what
gets built.  Most hackers don't want to work on their hackathon project after
the hackathon ends.  Your Twilio or SendGrid credits run out, your app
crashes, you shut down your localhost.  Who knows.

The point is, if you're looking to get long term customers out of the hacks
that get built, you're at the wrong event.

![Get Startups: Alternatives](/img/dont-throw-that-hackathon/page0027.jpg)

A better alternative might be a Startup Weekend or one of the month-long app
developer contests.  NYC Big Apps and Evernote DevCup are great examples of
events that promote building sustainable businesses over the course of a month
and have a much higher retention rate than a 24 hour hackathon.

![Spawn Innovation](/img/dont-throw-that-hackathon/page0028.jpg)

Another type of company I often hear from is the kind that wants to spawn
innovation in their industry.  Often these are non-profits or companies that
have an innovation or social good branch.  They want to support the people
that are building game changing technology.

![Spawn Innovation: Problem](/img/dont-throw-that-hackathon/page0029.jpg)

The problem is that most hacks aren't innovative.  It's really hard to build
cutting edge technology in a weekend.  Most hacks are actually mashups of APIs
and existing tools.  There are certainly exceptions to that rule, but you're
gambling if you're counting on it to make your event a success.

![Spawn Innovation: Alternative](/img/dont-throw-that-hackathon/page0030.jpg)

The alternative here is to support the people that are already innovating in
your field.  That could come in the form of a grant, fund, mentorship, etc.
These are some of the more successful examples that I could think of.  I bet
if you just researched startups that were working on problems that you're
interested in solving that you would find a ton that could use your
support.  Help the existing folks before you start trying to onboard new 
people to compete with them

![Meet Community](/img/dont-throw-that-hackathon/page0031.jpg)

Other companies just want to meet and support their existing communities.
Often they'll throw a conference or meetup and tack a hackathon on to the end
of it because they think developers will engage around the event.  The
intentions here are certainly on target, but the execution is the questionable
part.

![Meet Community: Problem](/img/dont-throw-that-hackathon/page0032.jpg)

Hackathons and conferences don't really tend to mix well.  People are usually
more interested in socializing and hanging out with other smart people than
building something new.  Just providing a good atmosphere for people to network
and have fun is actually way more on target than forcing a hackathon on them
as a second thought.  The hackathon ends up being a distraction and a
non-priority and ultimately isn't as good as it could be as a serrate event.

![Meet Community: Alternative](/img/dont-throw-that-hackathon/page0033.jpg)

The alternative here is to focus on throwing a really great conference or
meetup.  These are some events that I've seen that do an excellent job of
highlighting the community around a company.

A good example of this in action is TwilioCon's hackathon.  The event last
year was sub-par because it was crammed into the end of the conference.  The
quality of the hacks was pretty low and the turnout wasn't so hot either.
This year they ran this thing called "Hacker Olympics" instead.  It was much
better suited for the fun environment of a conference and went over
phenomenally.

![Why Should you throw a hackathon](/img/dont-throw-that-hackathon/page0034.jpg)

So now that we've talked thoroughly about why you shouldn't throw an event,
let's talk about the cases when you should.  I'm running short on time, so I'm
just going to briefly talk about these points.  I may expand on them further
at a later time.

![Geography](/img/dont-throw-that-hackathon/page0035.jpg)

The most obvious reason that you should throw a hackathon is geography.
Cities that don't have a lot of hackathons happening in them are prime targets
for companies to come in and run hackathons at.  A great example of this in
action is the work that SendGrid, Twilio, Mashery, and TokBox do with API
Hackday.  They throw hackathons all over the world in cities that don't
necessarily have a lot of events.  Sometimes they'll do it a few days before a
conference or something to help boost attendance, but for the most part
they're independent hackathons.  Also, Hack the Midwest is another good
example of a successful hackathon that popped up in an underserved market.

![Geography](/img/dont-throw-that-hackathon/page0036.jpg)

Here's another protip: New York, San Francisco, and Boston are completely
saturated with good events.  It's also really hard to compete with the one's that
have already established a name for themselves.  In general, unless you have
a really good reason and a bulletproof marketing strategy, I would steer
clear.

![Targeting](/img/dont-throw-that-hackathon/page0037.jpg)

Another reason it might be a good idea to throw a hackathon is if you're
targeting a specific group of people for some reason.  For example, Greylock
does an invite only hackathon where they invite the top talent that they want
to work with their portfolio companies.  It works out really well for them
because the people that they're inviting feel like they've earned it in some
way. 

![Launches](/img/dont-throw-that-hackathon/page0038.jpg)

A final reason that it might be a good idea to throw a hackathon is when
you're launching some brand new API or product.  This isn't universally true
and will only be effective if it's some kind of extra fast-paced feedback
loop.  Companies that employ that Product Feedback strategy at hackathons tend
to do the best with this kind of event.

![Thanks](/img/dont-throw-that-hackathon/page0039.jpg)

So that's all the time I have.  There are certainly other reasons to throw or
not throw a hackathon, but you'll have to ask me about them at another time.
I think the big takeaway I want to leave you with here is that you should
really focus on optimizing your strategy for approaching hackathons.  If
you're going to throw your own, make sure it really meets the goals that
you're trying to accomplish.

I'd love to hear your thought on the subject.  Thanks for having me!
