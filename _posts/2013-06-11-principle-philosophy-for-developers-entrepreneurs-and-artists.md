title: Principle Philosophy
---

Here are my slides and a paraphrased summary of some of the things that I talked
about at [DjangoCon EU 2013](http://djangocon.eu/).  You can find the [full slides on
SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/theycallmeswift/principle-philosophy-for-developers-entrepreneurs-and-artists)
and there's even [a video of the talk on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWCWkRXlN94).

![Title Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0003.jpg)

Originally this talk was called, "How to build the tools that developers want to
use." I later cancelled the talk to focus on something slightly different
instead.  While working on that original talk, I came up with a number of
pointers about how to make great software that people want to use again and
again.

This got me to thinking about why I was coming up with these specific
suggestions, because while I definitely agreed with them in certain contexts, I
didn't think they were universally useful or true.  So, I got to thinking about
how I made decisions and came up with something that was a little more
fundamental to my identity as a developer, entrepreneur, and artist, an idea I
call "Principle Philosophy."

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0005.jpg)

The first thing to note is that I'm not talking about your school principal;
instead, I'm talking about the other kind of principles.  The ones that help us
make decisions on a day-to-day basis.  The guidelines that we use when we're
making choices.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0006.jpg)

I want to combine the principles I use with this idea of philosophy, which is
just a way of thinking about, discussing, and studying ideas in an intellectual
manner.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0007.jpg)

When we take those two ideas and combine them, we end up with "Principle
Philosophy," which is just a way of thinking about and discussing the rules that
dictate our behaviors - our principles.  Specifically, I want to look at the
principles that I've picked up over the years that have made me a better
developer, entrepreneur and artist.  And, I want to share them with you in the
hope that they will help you as well.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0008.jpg)

So, let's take a step back and talk about who I am.  Just to avoid any
confusion, I am going to say at the outset that, despite the handsome
resemblance, I am not Ryan Golsing. I'm actually Swift, a developer evangelist
over at [SendGrid](http://sendgrid.com).  If you've never heard of SendGrid,
we're an API company that makes it super simple to send and receive emails.  I'm
also one of the founders of [Hacker League](http://hackerleague.org), which is a
platform for people who organize and attend hackathons.

These roles are developer and startup facing, giving me the the privilege of
being able to help them a lot.  Specifically, I have the opportunity to help
them succeed and get better at what they do.  I find that very rewarding, which
I trace back to some of the principles my parents taught me when I was growing
up.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0009.jpg)

I was my parent's first child and one of the first things they did was to
identify a good success metric.  How do we know we've done a good job raising
our son?  The answer, they decided, was that they wanted me to be a "Good
Person," by which they meant they wanted me to be a successful, contributing
member of society who worked hard and did the right thing.

So, they found themselves asking, "How can we raise our son to be a good
person?"  The answer that they came up with goes back to those principles that
we talked about a little earlier.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0010.jpg)

If you lay out a strong foundation for somebody that's based on good, reliable
rules and they don't do anything to violate those principles, then they'll do
well in life.  That makes sense, right?

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0011.jpg)

So they were teaching me things like:

- Always do my best
- Don't be a quitter
- Help those less fortunate
- Don't steal

The list goes on, but I knew that as long as I stuck to the rules on the
list, then I would end up as a "good" person.

And, this all makes senses.  However, I think that the way that we go about
approaching these things and thinking about them is total bullshit.  I'll
tell you why.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0012.jpg)

It's because the rules as given are very black and white concepts.  Either I'm
stealing or I'm not, either I'm doing my best or I'm not.  However, most
situations that you encounter on a day-to-day basis don't actually fit into
this black and white, boolean way of thinking.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0013.jpg)

The truth is that life is more like gray and gray.  We end up using tools like
pro / con checklists to decide which side of that black and white line
something falls on, but it's very rare that something falls cleanly on one
side or another.

Up to this point, I don't think that any of this should be terribly
surprising to anyone, because we make these decisions on a daily basis.
But, I think something that's a lot more interesting is how we go about
answering this next question.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0014.jpg)

How can I be a good programmer?  When we think about the ways that
programmers make decisions, we consider them to be logical and methodical
people.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0015.jpg)

After all, they deal with things like code or math all day.  These things
are built in steps and are either right or wrong (*read: black and white*).
That's a little scary, considering that we just talked about how bad black and
white paradigms are for gray inputs.

But, being logical, methodical people, programmers must have a better system
for deciding what's good and bad, right?

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0016.jpg)

The truth is we don't.  We go around saying things like:

- Don't repeat yourself in code
- Write tests
- Open Source your tools
- Blah, blah, blah 

These are the the same old black and white rules that we've been having
problems with on a day-to-day basis and we expect them to handle our
super gray inputs.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0017.jpg)

The even sillier thing is that we get so passionate about these
things, that we go on the Internet and yell at each other because we
don't agree with the way that other people interpret these principles.
People fight over principles like "ruby is better than python" or "you
shouldn't write unit test," all of which are absolutely absurd.  We
all know that applying these gray inputs to black and white functions
is a craps shoot.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0018.jpg)

We seem to still think that we have a decision making function that
looks some thing like this.  We get a thing.  We take a look at the
thing.  If the thing is good we, do it and if it's not, we don't.
But, guess what?  It doesn't actually work like that.

The questions I would raise next are, "How do we know what's good?"
and "how do we know what's worth doing?".  And it's really hard to
answer those without  talking about this guy.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0019.jpg)

[Immanuel Kant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant).  If you
don't know him, he's a German philosopher who lived during the
Enlightment.  He's widely considered to be the Godfather of modern
philosophy, because it's difficult to have a philosophical discussion
without bringing up either arguments he made or arguments others made
that were influenced by him.

He had a number of arguments that are still relevant today, especially
in regard to morality and how that functions with our ability to
reason.  These next few slides are a summary of some of those
arguments and my interpretation of them.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0020.jpg)

The first thing Kant wanted to know was why we have the ability to
reason.  Why do we have this gift of being able to think logically
about things?  This question is incredibly relevant to our earlier
discussion of programmers.

A lot of people would say that our ability to reason must be meant to
be used for our own happiness, but Kant disagreed.  If life was about
going around being happy then we would just follow our instincts.  The
choices become pretty obvious when all you're thinking about is
yourself all the time.  But, the truth is, we do things all the time
that are not in our own best interests.  Kant argued that since this
is true, reason must be around for some other purpose.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0021.jpg)

He theorized that our reasoning must be around for us to be good. That
the fact that we're capable of reason, means that we must be capable
of moral, good decisions.  This brings us back to the original
question that I posed and fits with my parents model and the
principles that they were trying to instill in me.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0022.jpg)

How do we actually know if something is good?  Kant had this
three-pronged argument.  This is a really condensed version of these
three points, so I highly recommend you read [the full thing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant#Moral_philosophy)
yourself if you want to get a deeper view.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0023.jpg)

The first prong was this idea of duty.  Duty is some kind of moral
or legal obligation that you have to fulfill.  Kant said that good
things always come from our pursuit of duty, that as you're pursuing
these moral obligations, good things will come naturally.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0024.jpg)

But, not all things we do from duty are necessarily good.  An 
example of this might be something like open source.  If you're open
sourcing code because you feel some kind of obligation to pay back the
developers who open sources before you, you're doing it from duty but it
wouldn't be a fit for Kant's definition of good will.  On the contrary, open
sourcing code because you intrinsically feel it's the right thing to do would
fit that definition.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0025.jpg)

The next thing Kant got into was that the morality of an action
should be separate from the goal or the actual outcome of that
action.  It has to come from the underlying principles that you
build on - "the principle of the will" as he called it.  You can
do things that are good that have a bad result; things that are
the right thing to do, but just happen to have a crappy outcome.
And that doesn't make the decision to act bad or anything, it
just means it had a bad outcome.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0026.jpg)

The third thing was the idea of universal lawfulness.  This is the idea that you
shouldn't do something unless you're okay with literally everyone else in the
world being able to do that thing too.  So, we don't steal because then there
would be no sense of ownership, as everyone would just steal from each other.
Likewise, maybe tests are universally acceptable, because it would be okay for
everyone to rigidly test everything unconditionally (just an example).

I think all of these rules provide a pretty good foundation for how we decide if
things are good or bad, right or wrong, and I agree with everything that Kant
has said so far.  But, the part where we start to differ is here:

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0027.jpg)

The idea of priori vs posteriori knowledge.  Kant said that the things that we
do that are good must come from priori knowledge, which is knowledge that we
just naturally have; our gut moral feelings.  Alternatively, our posteriori
knowledge comes from our experiences and is based on our subjective knowledge
and therefore, Kant argued, cannot be moral.

I totally disagree with this, because I think it's impossible for us to
totally separate out our decisions from our past experiences and yet I think I
make plenty of good, moral choices daily while relying on those experiences.
In fact, our principles are directly tied to our experiences as many of them
develop directly out of things we've gone through.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0028.jpg)

I think Gandhi actually summed that up really nicely in this quote. 

> "A man is the sum of his actions, of what he has done, of what he can do,
> nothing else."

What he's getting at here is how impossible it is to separate ourselves from
our past experiences.  So I want to take this, and revisit that really naive
function that we defined before.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0029.jpg)

It probably looks something a little more like this in reality.  We look at
more than just some arbitrary boolean when we make decisions.  We actually
calculate a value based on our past experiences and
their outcomes.  If we don't have anything in our experiences that would fit
the specific case, then we weigh the good against the bad and make a decision
based on that.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0030.jpg)

Essentially we boil down to the sum of our experiences; we are this value. The
best thing that we can possibly do for ourselves, therefore, is optimize our
experiences so that this expression evaluates to be as large as possible; we
need the biggest pool of things to draw on when we're making decisions.

There's two ways we can go about doing this.  The first way is through our
first-hand experiences, which are the things that we're doing every day.
These are the choices we make and the results of those choices are evaluated
in our own subjective context.

The second way is the reason that things like conferences and networking
events are so important: your network experience.  These are the experiences
that your friends, mentors, family, peers have been through and share with
you. These let us expand our foundation of experiences to draw from at an
exponential rate.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0031.jpg)

Everything looks different from the outside.  Unless you've gone through
something  or know someone who's gone through something, it can be hard to
make the right decision. So the knowledge that you get from your network and
the knowledge that you get from making choices every day is super important.
Without it, we can't possibly find the answer to questions like, "Am I a good
programmer or person?"

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0032.jpg)

Up to this point, we've talked a lot about the theory about how we make
decisions; about what makes something good and bad; about how important
principles are for building up a foundation; about how important the
experiences that we go through are.  But, now I want to get more into the
practice.  I want to tell you a story about an experience that I got a ton of
value from and how it made me a better programmer, entrepreneur, and artist.
I hope this helps you, too.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0033.jpg)

This story is actually about [Little League](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_League_Baseball).
If you're not familiar with
Little League, it's a suburban American tradition where little kids get
together on Saturdays and play baseball.  Parents come to watch them play and
cheer for their kids' teams.

I played in my town's Little League from the first day I was eligible until
the last day I was eligible, but it wasn't because I was great at baseball.
It was actually quite the opposite case.  I was *horrible* at baseball.  I
could barely catch the ball, I definitely couldn't throw it, and sometimes
while swinging the bat, I would accidentally let go and it would hit people.

Overall, it was a really horrible experience and I *hated* it.  I wasn't
motivated to even try, because I was so bad.  I really wanted to quit.  One
day, I approached my parents and said, "Mom, Dad, I know you think it's a
good idea for me to play Little League because I'm meeting people and doing
something athletic.  But, the truth is, I hate it and don't want to do it
anymore.  I quit."

My parents looked at me and said, "Hang on, we need a minute to talk about
this".  They went outside, chatted for a few minutes and then came back to
pass their ruling.  They looked at me and said something to the effect of
"No, you're not quitting.  We aren't raising a quitter for a son."

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0034.jpg)

Instead of motivating me to go out and give Little League a second try, this
actually made me even more unmotivated to try to find value in baseball.  So
rather than sitting the bench or half-assingly playing right field, I would
do things like laying down in the grass instead.  Then, at least,
the coach would pull me out and send me on my way home early.

My teammates became increasingly hostile towards me, because they could
tell I wasn't even trying to play anymore.  Effectively, I accomplished
the complete opposite of what my parents were trying to get me to do.  I
had quit without actually quitting.

My parents saw what was going on and tried to figure out a way to motivate
me and get me to find some value from the whole experience.  What they
came up with was a monetary incentive.  They promised me $100 if I could
ever manage to hit a home run.  At the time, that was a lot of money to
me, especially considering I wasn't actually doing any serious manual
labor to earn it.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0035.jpg)

I got it in my head that I wanted this $100 more than anything.  Things
started to change.  I would go to baseball games and actually try to hit
the ball.  Don't get me wrong, I didn't get better over night.  It was a
very rocky road along the way and I still sucked at baseball, but I
managed to slowly improve, inch by inch.  I managed to hit the ball a few
times and everyone was more supportive now that I was actually trying.

Fast forward to some time near the end of my Little League career.  It
wasn't the last game.  It wasn't the bottom of the 9th.  The bases weren't
loaded. There was nothing dramatic about this day except that I only had a
few chances left to hit that home run.  I get up to bat this particular
day.  The pitcher throws the ball.  I close my eyes and swing the bat as
hard as I possibly can.

Crack.  I make contact and the ball goes flying.  I look up and the ball
is sailing towards that fence.  Closer and closer every second, I can feel
that it's going to go over.

But it doesn't.  It falls just short of the fence.  No home run once again.

I look up and at this moment realize that the entire time this was
happening, *I never started running*.  All these people, my parents, my
coach, my teamates, are behind me screaming at the top of their lungs,
wanting me to run. Go! Go! Go! I start running.

Needless to say, I was out before I even hit first base.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0036.jpg)

The sad ending to this story is that I never actually hit that home run.
I never accomplished that goal, but I certainly learned a lot from that
whole experience.  In hindsight, I think the thing that was so important
to me wasn't necessarily the money that my parents had promised me.
Instead it was that I wanted to make them happy, or proud, or show them
that I could do it. 

I want to examine some of the other things I learned from that experience
and talk about how they made me a better programmer, entrepreneur, and
artist.  Hopefully, this will help you learn to examine some of your own
experiences and principles too.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0037.jpg)

The first thing that I learned was to always "swing for the fences".  And
I know that's kind of a cliche when you're talking about baseball.  Ha.
But seriously, I think having a broad vision is super important for
equipping yourself for major success down the road.

There are several reasons for this, but mainly it prevents burnout and
enables you to take bigger risks.  I also think people tend to understand
big goals more easily than little ones, so they're certainly easier to
share with other people.

As a developer, this has been instrumental to the way that I do my job.
Developers have this tendency to stick with what they know.  If you're a
Django dev and every day all you do is write Django apps, well there isn't
much of a
chance that one day you'll wake up and decide to write your next
production app in Rails or Node.js.  Having a large goal enables you to
take dramatic, deviating risks because you have a lot of ground to cover
anyway.

I have a good example of this.  At the time, I was working at
[Crowdtap](http://crowdtap.com/) as a
Rails developer.  We had this monolithic test suite that would take three
hours to run.  So every day, we would push branches to CI and then three
hours later they'd come back red, at which point we'd have to stop what we
were doing and fix them.  Not very productive.

So one day, the CTO comes to me and asks me to work on cutting down the
time it takes to run the suite.  I set a large goal for myself.  I wanted
to cut the time in half.  To get there, I could have done the obvious
things like moving to a faster box, caching, cutting down database calls,
etc.  But, since I had such a large goal, I went for something totally
radical in Node.js and managed to cut out 25 minutes from the build
([details](/2012/05/01/excuse-me-thats-not-an-integration-test/),
[slides](https://speakerdeck.com/theycallmeswift/integration)).  It wasn't
the hour and a half I wanted, but it was probably more than I would have
gotten playing close to the vest.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0038.jpg)

The next thing I want to talk about is about having small goals to build
up to your big ones.  I never consciously planned this out while I was
playing baseball, but between where I started and that attempted home run,
there was a lot of ground for me to cover.  I made a ton of incremental
steps that helped me get to where I ended up, and the same has held true
for my software engineering career.

I maintain a library called [Breakfast
Serial](https://github.com/theycallmeswift/BreakfastSerial), which helps
programmers talk to Arduinos using Python.  It gives them a set of
simple, high level objects to work with so they can build things quickly
and iterate.  My big goal for the library is to be the best library out
there for Arduino and Python, but I can't just do that over night.  To
get there, I've been setting and completing small goals of adding
individual components to the library.  First it was LEDs, then buttons,
then sensors, and so on.  Small steps forward.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0039.jpg)

Another lesson I learned, is that it's totally fine to be bad at things.
You don't have to be good at everything you do and, in fact, being bad
can help you gain a new perspective on things.  People at the top don't
usually start from the bottom, so you can end up with the upper hand
because you think of things differently.

[Hacker League](http://hackerleague.org/) has been a great example of
that for me.  When I started Hacker League, I had actually never even
won a hackathon.  I had a history riddled with failure and
disappointment.  A year and a half later, we've run over 300 events
including big names like [Tech Crunch
Disrupt](https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/techcrunch-disrupt-nyc-2013)
and [Evernote's
DevCup](https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/evernote-devcup-2013).

Being at the bottom gave me the insight to focus on things that were
more important than sponsorship and who won because I learned their
value first hand, and we ended up better off for it.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0040.jpg)

This is a quote that most people attribute to Mark Twain, but I'm pretty
sure that's not true.

> "Quitting is easy.  I've done it thousands of times."

Usually it's used in reference to smoking, drinking, or gambling, but
what I really want to talk about here is that quitting can be the easy
way out.  My parents were absolutely right about this and it's been
instrumental to my personal development that they didn't let me quit.

One of the hardest things when you're building tools for other people
to use is when no one ends up using them.  I maintain a number of
repositories that almost nobody, including myself, uses any more.  And
that's hard, right?  Why would you want to work on something that
nobody is using when the easy thing to do would be not work on them?
If someone submits a bug, it's just one person, so what does it matter?

Persistence is really the key for success.  And I don't mean to say
that you can't ever quit anything, I just mean that you should give a
valiant effort before you can legitimately stop something.  Just like
when I was playing
baseball and not trying, things got a lot better once I started to put
real effort into it. The same is also true for software engineering. 

The end might not be anywhere in sight, and you might never hit that
home run, but giving something a shot and refusing to give up on it can
be the difference between mediocrity and success.

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0041.jpg)

There are way more examples in the [video of this
talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWCWkRXlN94),  so if you're
interested I highly recommend checking that out.

We've talked about a lot of things, here.  How we make choices, how we
decide what's good, how our experiences and principles help us do those
things as well as examples of some of this in action.  Where do we go
from here?

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0043.jpg)

Back to our original question: "*How can I be a good X?*".  These kinds
of questions are fundamentally flawed.  We know that everyone has a
different foundation and pool of experience to draw from.  We know that
one size doesn't fit all when it comes to making the right choice.  We
know that experiences and principles are relative to ourselves even
though we may share them with other people.  So, I think we need to
start asking better questions.

We should start asking ourselves things like, "How can I can be a
**better** programmer, entrepreneur, or artist?"  And all we have to do
is optimize the materials that we rely on to make decisions. 

![Slide](/img/principle-philosophy/page0046.jpg)

I want to leave you with some action items,  I realize that these are
pretty general, but just think about them the next time you're making a
decision or you're criticizing someone else's decisions.

- Build a strong foundation of principles
- Remember, one size doesn't fit all
- Learn from and share your experiences
- Build a great network
- Ask the right questions

Even when things are totally unrelated to programming, your
experiences and the principles that you're building from those
experiences helps to shape that part of your life and your
decisions.  Those experiences will help you become a better
programmer, entrepreneur, artist, or whatever you may be.
