<h1 class="post-title">I hate Honeydew <small>or: Why you should always ask "why?" <em>(Oct 03, 2012)</em></small></h1>

During breakfast today I was reminded of one of the most common pitfalls of user testing and
customer validation.  I ordered this thing called "The Tutti Frutti Special", which is 
essentially a sticky bun that's cut in half with an egg on one half and a bunch of fresh fruit 
on the other.  For the unimaginative, here's a picture.

<div class="center">
  <a class="th" href="/img/tutti-frutti.png">
    <img src="/img/tutti-frutti-small.png" alt="The Tutti Frutti Special" />
  </a>
</div>

I wasn't really all that hungry to begin with, but I managed to get the half with the egg down
and picked at the other half until my fullness got the best of me and I gave up.  Eventually,
the waitress came back to ask if I was done.  She picked up the plate to take it away and said,
_"Wow you must really like honeydew, you barely touched any of the other fruit"_.

__I hate honeydew melon__.

No really, it's the worst fruit ever.  It's way too watery and has barely any taste. I've never enjoyed
it and I probably never will.  But totally disregarding my feelings for the 
_[Cucumis melo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeydew_%28melon%29)_, she was right.  I'd eaten every bit 
of honeydew melon on my plate.  The part she was wrong about was the essential "why?" that everyone seems 
to overlook when they do user testing.

The real reason the melon was gone was that originally I intended to eat all the fruit on my plate.
I thought that by eating the melon first, I would be able to enjoy the rest of my meal without the awful
interruption of honeydew.  Little did I know, I'd be full way before then anyway.

This story is a great example of why you should always ask "why?" when you perform user tests or do
customer validation.  Simply observing your users is never enough.  User actions can lie, even if they
seem straight forward.  The only way to truly understand your users is to find out _why_ they made the
choices they did.  So ask.
