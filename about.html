    <p>Hey there! I'm Swift, the co-founder and CEO of Major League Hacking, the world's official student hackathon league.  I've made it my personal mission to enable hackers by helping them get the tools and resources they need to turn their crazy ideas into reality.  I previously founded Hacker League (acquired by Intel in 2013) and was formerly a developer evangelist for SendGrid.  Some people also known me for my champion crab-walking abilities and for my mastery of the board game Clue.</p>
