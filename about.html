    <p>Hey there! My name is Mike, but you can call me Swift.  I like to think of myself as a "Middle-end" developer.  I dabble in frontend, I dabble in backend, but the part I'm really good at is connecting the dots. A problem solver, if you will. Right now I'm a developer evangelist for this awesome outfit called <a href="http://sendgrid.com" title="SendGrid">SendGrid</a> and I'm also one of the founders of <a href="http://hackerleague.org/" title="Hacker League">Hacker League</a>. You can read my story <a href="/about.html" title="About Swift">here</a> and follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/SwiftAlphaOne" title="Follow me on Twitter">Twitter</a> for updates.</p>
